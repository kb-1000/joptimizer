# joptimizer
joptimizer was supposed to be an advanced analytic bytecode analyzer, improving on my previous work as part of [bytecode-optimizer](https://github.com/kb-1000/bytecode-optimizer).

It was never finished, and this is an archive of its last development state.
I won't work on it again, though I might try to revisit the concept in a new project in future.

Feel free to learn from it or from my mistakes. If you want to use this code (although I can't imagine a lot of uses for it), please contact me.
